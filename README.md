# Face Mask Detection

## App Demo - [Mask Detection](http://54.164.48.70:8501/)


## Problem Description

Detect from an image of a person, if mask is worn or not. If mask is worn, is it worn partially or fully.




## Data

Train Data

• Fully worn mask images : 1624

• Partially worn mask images: 1294 

• No mask worn images: 2138



## Roadmap

Preprocessing/Augmentation:

- Normalization
- Random Resized Crop

Network Design and Training:

- Model Design (Resnet50)

- Set up Training for Model

- Train and Evaluate model

Build App:

- Use Streamlit to develop app for the model prediction

Deploy:

- Upload trained model, application file, requirements file and proc file in github repository

- Pass the repository link to the Heroku for Deployment
